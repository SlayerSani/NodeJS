// Q: is console.log in web broweser and noejs is the same or different
// Ans: The console.log function behaves similarly in web browsers and Node.js, 
// but there are some differences. In both environments, console.log is used to output 
// messages to the console. However, in web browsers, the console is typically part of 
// the developer tools and is primarily used for debugging and monitoring client-side 
// JavaScript code. In Node.js, the console is a built-in module that provides similar 
// functionality but is used for server-side JavaScript development. Additionally, 
// Node.js offers additional console methods and configuration options compared to 
// web browsers, such as writing console output to files or streams. 
// Despite these differences, the basic usage of console.log remains consistent across 
// both environments.
